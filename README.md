# Pynch - A Python-Based Web Crawler

Modelled after Apache Nutch, Pynch is a Python-based web crawler.

## Acknowledgements

A significant portion of the code in this project was tool-assisted. Content built using GitHub CoPilot and OpenAI ChatGPT.

## Requirements

* Python 3.9
* Java 8


## Plugins

### parse-tika

The Tika parser requires Java to be installed on your system to run the Tika server.
An existing Tika server can be specified in the configuration.


## Crawl Lifecycle

Pynch is a web crawler that operates in several steps or phases to collect, parse, and index web pages. The major crawl steps in Pynch are:

1. Inject: The crawler starts by collecting a set of URLs, called seeds, which are used to initiate the crawl. These seeds are typically provided by the user or generated by the crawler itself.
2. Generate: In this step, the crawler generates a list of URLs to crawl based on the crawl database. The crawler may also filter out URLs that have already been crawled or are not relevant to the crawl.
3. Fetch: In this step, the crawler sends HTTP requests to the URLs obtained in the seed selection phase to download their web pages. The pages are downloaded in HTML or other formats based on the content type.
4. Parse: Once the pages are downloaded, Nutch parses them to extract structured information such as text, links, and metadata. Parsing also includes filtering out non-relevant data such as ads, images, and formatting tags.
5. Index: In this step, the parsed data is indexed in a search engine to facilitate fast search and retrieval. The index is usually stored in a separate database optimized for search.
6. Update: The crawler periodically revisits previously crawled pages to check for changes in content and update the index with any new information. This process is known as incremental crawling.

These steps are typically performed in a loop until the crawl is completed, with the crawler revisiting and updating pages based on a set of configurable parameters such as the crawl depth, politeness delay, and content freshness.

Generally, these steps correspond to the following common classes in Pynch:
1. injector.py - Injector plugins prefix: `inject_`
2. generator.py - Generator plugins prefix: `generate_`
3. fetcher.py - Fetcher plugins prefix: `fetch_`
4. parser.py - Parser plugins prefix: `parse_`
5. indexer.py - Indexer plugins prefix: `index_`
6. updater.py - Updater plugins prefix: `update_`

Plugins are only loaded if they are enabled in the configuration and are only run in their corresponding step.
